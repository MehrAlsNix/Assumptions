Custom runners may behave differently.\r\n\r\nWe have included several assumptions like `assumeTrue`, `assumeExtensionLoaded`,... by default. All of those functions are subsumed in assumeThat, with the appropriate `Hamcrest` matcher.\r\n\r\nA failing assumption in a `@before` or `@beforeClass` method will have the same effect as a failing assumption in each `@test` method of the class.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe concept behind **Assumptions for PHPUnit** is based on the adequate junit feature, which is documented on their [wiki - Assumptions with assume](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Assumptions-with-assume)\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\nThere is a similar feature in PHPUnit called [@requires](https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/appendixes.annotations.html#appendixes.annotations.requires)!\r\n\r\nIf you are familiar in using `@requires` annotation to dedicate that a given [requirement](https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/incomplete-and-skipped-tests.html#incomplete-and-skipped-tests.requires.tables.api) would be given and you are happy about, then you just do not need the use of **Assumption for PHPUnit**.\r\n\r\nBut if you want to have\r\n- code completion\r\n- better readability\r\n- finer control\r\n- more requirement abilities\r\n\r\nthen you should give **Assumption for PHPUnit** a try.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n[see wiki:installation](https://github.com/MehrAlsNix/Assumptions/wiki/1.-Installation)\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n[see wiki:examples](https://github.com/MehrAlsNix/Assumptions/wiki/2.-Examples)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n- PHP >= 5.6\r\n","google":"UA-41451982-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
