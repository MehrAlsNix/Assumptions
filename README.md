PHPUnit implementation of the junit feature "assumptions".
You can read more of it on their wiki:

> Ideally, the developer writing a test has control of all of the forces that
> might cause a test to fail. If this isn't immediately possible, making
> dependencies explicit can often improve a design. For example, if a test fails
> when run in a different locale than the developer intended, it can be fixed by
> explicitly passing a locale to the domain code.
